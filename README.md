# PUPPY MEMORY GAME
#### Video Demo: 
#### Description: Puppy Memory Game is a card flipping and matching memory game with puppy photos. My goal was to create a fun game that would utilize quick memorization skills, further making the game more memorizable as it includes something I love and I think will catch the attention of users, dogs. The game has an extra hard mode after mastering the default mode, which expands the number of cards and includes a surprise of kittens photos.

#### -index.html: Is the main webpage that includes the title of the webpage, links to style.css and javascript of the website. Also containing a side-panel where the buttons and messages appear for the game.
#### -script.js: Contains most of the handling and functions happening within the game, assigning photos, arrays, matching cards, shuffling, and commands for when each button is pressed.
#### -styles.css: The styles of the website, the game header that displays the title, button sizes, position and colors. As well as being interactable with the curser of the user.
#### Credits: I did use an ai tool, chat gpt. For correcting syntax errors and giving me suggestions on how I should format my program and how I could do specific functions.
